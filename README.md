# Canvas
## Canvas drawing website

## In this project, my user will be able to use the Canvas that I provide on the website to able do some drawing and also give the user options that they can play the whole process of their drawing and save their draws on the local machine, as well as retrieve their draws by reading the file saved on a computer.

## Users can learn how to use the instructions in the upper right cornerã€‚

## The artifact I learned from this project is the front-end interaction of the website. This project seems to be a very simple drawing program, but the main purpose of the project is to teach me how to realize the interaction between the website and the local computer. I think this project brought me a concept of the front and back ends of the website, which gave me a basis of knowledge in my future work.
